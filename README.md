THIS IS MY COLLEGE MAJOR PROJECT!!
Feel free to snoop around and it does provides insightfull knowledge about LSTMs/GRU and Music Theory.


The project is divided into two parts
First the preprocessing should be done [Use preprocess.ipynb], which will add contents and will create the project in the directory itself
then comes generating the the notes. [Use generateMusic.ipynb]
Generated results will be shown in the result folder and you can use the following website to listen to the midi file.

The project was a comparitive study and to showcase that LSTMs can be used as for generating music and further tells that the issues arrised in this must be addressed.
