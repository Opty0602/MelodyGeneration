THIS IS MY COLLEGE MAJOR PROJECT!!
<br>
Feel free to snoop around and it does provides insightfull knowledge about LSTMs/GRU and Music Theory.
<br>


The project is divided into two parts
First the preprocessing should be done **[Use preprocess.ipynb]**, which will add contents and will create the project in the directory itself
then comes generating the the notes. **[Use generateMusic.ipynb]**
Generated results will be shown in the result folder and you can use the following website to listen to the midi file. 
https://signal.vercel.app/

The project was a comparitive study and to showcase that LSTMs can be used as for generating music and further pinpoints that the issues arised in this must be addressed.
